Todo-list is a usefull but simple program made in C++

## Requirements

C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
git

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git

or download the file(s)

## Compile

I already compiled it for you but if you dont trust the .exe you can always compile if by yourself:

Open a terminal / cmd.

```
cd todo-list

g++ main.cpp todo.cpp -o todo

Or open the project in a code editor (recommand vscode) and visual studo codes should  create a .exe file for you.

Go to your path and open the .exe.
